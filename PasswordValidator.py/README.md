# PasswordValidator.py
Simple program that prompts the user to enter a secure password


Password Validator
This time, the user is setting their own password, and we want to make sure that a password is secure enough. Ask the user to input a password, and then input it again to confirm it. The application should verify that:

a) Both passwords match

b) The password is at least 8 characters long

If both checks pass, tell the user that they've successfully set the password. If they don't, tell the user what the problem was: Whether the passwords didn't match, or whether it was too short.
