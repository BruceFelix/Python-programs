# Pygame
## Drawing shapes, text and images on the screen with a small animation
This program will draw some shapes on the display, draw "hello world!" in the middle of the screen
and let an image go to every corner of the window. You can use every image you want, but you
will need to place the image file in the same directory as your program.
