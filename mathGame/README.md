Math Game This is an addition game. The developer (you) will prepare a number of addition questions, and then ask the player (also you, probably) to answer them. The game tells the player if their answer was correct or incorrect, and then at the end, tells them their total score.

Create a list: This list contains questions. A question is itself a list, which contains two numbers. Iterate through each question and ask the user for input: For example, if the two numbers of the question are 2 and 3, the input prompt should read something like "What's the answer to 2 + 3?"  

Compare the user input to the actual result of adding the 2 numbers together. If they are the same (i.e. the user answered correctly), print a success message and add 1 point to their score. If they are different, print out a not-as-much-success message (and don't change their score).  When they have answered all of the questions (correctly or incorrectly), print out their score.

*Stretch goal: Instead of just printing the player's score, print a message roughly assessing how well they did. If the player answered more than half of the questions right (i.e. their score is greater than half the length of the list of questions), print their score along with a flattering message about their prodigious numeracy. If their score is less than that, print their score along with an encouraging message about the importance of persistence.
