An interactive madlibs game prompting the user to replace the placeholders in capital letters with their own words
The program is not robust but rigid as per now as it is kind of repetitive.
It requires to be simple but I will get there.

I finally managed to write a shorter code by using a for loop.
Intially for every replacement to be made I wrote a line for it now I only use a simple for loop to iterate over everything
